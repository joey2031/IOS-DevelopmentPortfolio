# IOS-DevelopmentPortfolio

Portfolio of projects I did in my iOS development course at Seneca, written in Objective-C and Swift. The following projects are included in this repository:

- Calculator (Lab 2): A simple calculator to perform basic math operations.
- Image Viewer (Lab 3): A simple image viewer with previous and next buttons to view images. Image links are from images.freeimages.com and stored in an array to be fetched.
- Bitcoin App (Lab 4): Uses an API to get the price of Bitcoin based on the currency selected by the user.
* Raptors Ticket App (Assignment 1):
  * User selects the number of tickets and the type they want. When they click "buy," it shows them the total price.
  * The "Manager" button shows the next view, where the user can see a history of purchased tickets or select "reset" to reset the view controller. On the reset page, the user can enter how many tickets are available.
  * On the history page, if the user clicks on a transaction, it will show the details of it.
